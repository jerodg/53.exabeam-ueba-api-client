# Exabeam User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), API client.
Client library for Exabeam's UEBA REST API.

Developed for use with Exabeam V4.0.48 (I48.5 #48). The API is considered to be
an unsupported functionality by the developers and as such it can change at any 
time without notice or versioning of the API.

Developed for use with Python3.8+, however, it should work with 3.6/7+. There is
no guarantee that future development won't utilize 3.8+ specifc syntax.
